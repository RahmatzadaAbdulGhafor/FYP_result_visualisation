A cipher is an algorithm that converts plain text into ciphertext, which is nonsense unless you have a key that lets you undo the cipher. The process of making text secret is called encryption, and the reverse process is called decryption. Cryptographic techniques rely on keys that are known by both the sender and recipient. The sender encrypts a message using a key, and the recipient decrypts it using the same key. Key exchange uses an algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one, using one-way functions (mathematical operations) that are easy to do in one direction, but hard to reverse. Keys that can be used by both sender and receiver, to encrypt and decrypt messages, are called symmetric keys because the key is the same on both sides. Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, most often one that is public and another that’s private.

Think of it as a set of techniques to protect the secrecy, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data against threats. Authentication refers to the process by which a computer understands who it is interacting with. There are three types of authentication: what you know, what you have, and what you are. Often, security experts suggest using two or more forms of authentication (two-factor or multi-factor authentication) for important accounts. Permissions or Access Control Lists (ACLs) describe the access each user has to view or modify any file, folder, or program on a computer. Malicious software called malware can make a program or computing system vulnerable to attacks that copy user data and allow hackers to disguise as the user.      ™ This video discusses some classic examples of the ways that hackers break into computer systems.

I've checked it out! Check the box to collect 16 minutes of SkillsBuild learning credit. The most common forms of computer security are known as cryptography. System architects employ these strategies to make information secret to frustrate attackers. A cipher is an algorithm that converts plain text into ciphertext, which is nonsense unless you have a key that lets you undo the cipher. The process of making text secret is called encryption, and the reverse process is called decryption. Cryptographic techniques rely on keys that are known by both the sender and recipient. The sender encrypts a message using a key, and the recipient decrypts it using the same key. Key exchange uses an algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one, using one-way functions (mathematical operations) that are easy to do in one direction, but hard to reverse. Keys that can be used by both sender and receiver, to encrypt and decrypt messages, are called symmetric keys because the key is the same on both sides. Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, most often one that is public and another that’s private.
